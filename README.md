This project focused on analyzing customer behavior, restaurant performance, and delivery logistics using real-world-style business queries. It was a great way to apply SQL for practical data insights. Here's what I explored:
📌 Key Insights Uncovered with SQL:
🏙️ Identified all customers based in Delhi
⭐ Calculated the average rating of restaurants in Mumbai
🛒 Listed customers who have placed at least one order
🔢 Displayed the total number of orders per customer
💰 Computed total revenue generated by each restaurant
🏆 Ranked the top 5 restaurants by highest average rating
🚫 Found customers who have never placed an order
🏙️📦 Tracked the number of orders per customer specifically in Mumbai
📅 Listed all orders placed in the last 30 days
🚚 Identified delivery partners with more than one completed delivery
📆 Tracked customers who ordered on exactly three different days
🤝 Discovered the delivery partner who worked with the most unique customers
🧩 Matched customers from the same city who ordered from the same restaurant but on different dates
🛠 Tools Used : SQL 
 📂 Dataset : Mock Swiggy data (modeled for analysis)
This exercise deepened my understanding of query optimization, joins, grouping logic, and temporal filtering — all crucial skills in data analysis.
Would love to connect with others working on SQL or food-tech datasets! Let's share insights and grow together. 📈
